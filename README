OVERVIEW:
On startup, the OpenPage scene will display which
just acts like a loading screen. The main bulk of
the project is in the LegoScene. After the loading
screen, the game will load into sandbox mode. From
there, the button with three dots will bring up the
main menu where kits can be accessed and placed in
the world, multiplayer can be activated, and player
avatar can be customized.
LegoSceneMulti is the scene that is loaded when 
connected to multiplayer. It does not differ from 
the regular lego scene.

SANDBOX MODE (auto start in this mode):
The top buttons of the UI allow the following features:
- Lego menu where different bricks can be selected.
- Undo button to remove placed legos in last in first 
  out order.
- Zoom in to change from 3rd person to 1st person
  (auto start in 1st person)
- Zoom out to change from 1st person to 3rd person
- Menu button to bring up the main menu and change
  modes.

KIT MODE:
- Accessed via the main menu.
- Select a kit to spawn and place it in a valid location
  in the world.
- Kits can be rotated like legos.
- Once a kit is placed, go through the steps as indicated
  by the white lego.
- Kit mode may be cancelled at any time.

AVATAR CUSTOMIZATION:
- Accessed via the main menu.
- Hat options: witch hat, helmet, crown, none
- Back options: butterfly wings, turtle shell, jetpack,
  none
- Held item options: flowers, sword, spear
- 8 color options for all accessories above as well
  as skin, body, and legs
- Avatar display can be rotated in the menu to see all
  angles.
- Avatar settings persist after closing and reopening 
  app as well as loading in to multiplayer.
- Note: if avatar settings are changed in multiplayer, 
  they will not reflect in the scene until that session 
  is left. This is to prevent confusion of the players 
  as to who is who.

MULTIPLAYER:
- Accessed via the main menu.
- Select a room name that is a 1-4 digit number.
- If that rooms exists, join it. If it doesn't, create it.

  other players from making your legos invalid.
