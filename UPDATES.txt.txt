# USABILITY ISSUES #

Not clear which block is active/selected:

We added the outline script that shows an outline
only on the currently active lego indicating that
it can be manipulated (rotate/color cycle/move).
Once the block is placed and can no longer be
changed, the outline disappears.
---------------------------------------------------
Various issues with zoom/view

Due to the various feedbacks regarding zoom, we
reworked how it works entirely from the preliminary
prototype. Now, it is modeled after systems like
Skyrim where you load into the game in 1st person
mode. Zooming out one level takes you to a close
3rd person view, and zooming out one further level
takes you to a far 3rd person view. This way you can
choose between feeling like you are building (in 1st
person view), or exploring the world you built (3rd
person view).
---------------------------------------------------
Various issues with remembering button mappings

We added a graphic in the bottom left hand corner
that indicates the current functions of the
respective joystick buttons. Due to room constraints
it is not very descriptive, but serves enough of a
hint as to what the buttons do that people can use
it to navigate to the more detailed help menu if
necessary.
---------------------------------------------------
Reticle pointer is confusing.

Since we navigate the UI solely through the buttons,
some commented it was weird having the reticle
pointer, and they were confused by its existence.
Because we had no use for it we removed it.
---------------------------------------------------
Main UI icons too small/high.

We made the UI icons larger, increased their alpha
values (to make them less see-through to increase
visibility), and lowered their position on the
screen.
